A simple tool that helps users evaluate the strength of their passwords by checking if they meet essential security requirements. The tool validates if a password includes:
- At least 12 characters
- At least 1 alphanumeric character
- At least 1 symbol
- At least 1 number
- Feedback on password strength

## Features

- **Strength Check**: Analyzes whether the password meets common security standards for a strong password.
- **User Feedback**: Gives detailed feedback on which specific criteria the password fails to meet.
- **Guidance**: Displays friendly messages encouraging users to improve password security.

## How It Works

This tool evaluates your password based on the following criteria:
1. **Length**: The password must be at least 12 characters long.
2. **Alphanumeric**: At least one alphanumeric character (a letter or a number).
3. **Symbol**: At least one special symbol (e.g., @, #, $, %, etc.).
4. **Number**: At least one number (e.g., 0-9).

The tool provides a message indicating whether the password is strong or needs improvement, depending on whether all criteria are met.
